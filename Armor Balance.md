Armor is balanced around the fact that you shouldn't wear several things on the same layer. Do so at your own risk of making the game boring.

The armor in the mod is incredibly good. There will be specific armor items for different layers. A bulletproof undershirt, an armor suit on your normal layer, possibly an outer armor layer too.

All ballistic weave is strong, lightweight, and flexible. Think of wearing pajama pants made of kevlar. That's why it doesn't encumber.

Adamantine isn't particularly flexible but isn't ridiculously inflexible. You'd mainly do plates of armor away from joints. It won't encumber unless joints are armored.

Shadowsteel is dense and heavy. It's inflexible. It will encumber but protect a lot. Outside of good power armor it should cause encumbrance.

Imperial Steel is similar to regular steel but lighter. Less encumbrance, more protection.
