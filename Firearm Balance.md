Firearms are balanced very carefully due to the heavy increases in their power.

Guns made from superior materials get a few bonus points in damage but not a ton. Imperial steel guns use 21st century but get a few extra damage points.

Dispersion is always better on any essence-based weapon just due to materials used. MAG and recoil dampeners will also affect this.

Essence-based ammunition can only be fired from guns made from Adamantine/Shadowsteel, each base ammo type should have 30% more damage. If the gun only uses adamantine/s for the parts under pressure, then you need a recoil dampener or the parts under pressure might destroy the ones not. Otherwise the whole gun needs to be adamantine/s

Every MAG component should add 20% more damage per component onto the base firearm. The base is determined as default FMJ ammunition.

Recoil dampeners are required for this but I have no formula, maybe one per MAG component.

Both MAG components and recoil dampeners are hard to make


ARPEN is yet to be determined. My rough figure may be 10% per MAG barrel, and 20% extra on the ammo type, but this is not set in stone.

Knight Killers are due for balancing, currently uncraftable they will one day take extremely specialized esstech components.

Recoil is to be determined.

Enchantments shouldn't increase bullet damage on SGA weapons. Recoil, dispersion, or accuracy should be changed carefully. You don't use a telekinetic spell when a MAG component is used. Enchantments overall should be EXTREMELY CAREFULLY BALANCED. Adding insane power to already insane weapons would cause massive balance concerns, so I would focus on changing properties that don't affect combat performance, or that add new features and new attacks. An underbarrel mod that shoots fireballs can be called a "Firearm fireball enchant" and is a good way of adding combat effectiveness that doesn't change final weapon DPS.
