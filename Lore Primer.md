# The Imperials

Set in humanity's 30th Century, humanity is mostly unified under the Infinite Empire. With nearly half
of the Milky Way under their belt, this juggernaut is sustained through significant automation of basic labor,
cloning of trillions of people, and strict control of the flow of magic & information.

Currently they're locked in endless war on all sides, from the alien Commonwealth to human colonies and rebels.
People are safe and content, but largely ignored and denied rights. There is neither universal education nor taxation,
Public services are largely non-existent. Centralized government largely uses its civilian population as a human shield
against nuclear attacks. Only the most basic courts of law, policing, civilian infrastructure, and evironmental
protection is afforded through the junta, with the rest being handled by civilians. With little oversight but high safety,
civilians on the surface level seem to accept such rule. This is until one learns of the neural control chips.

In the 2100's the Imperial government manifested a physical form out of dark matter through the Kolibri Project. What can
only be described as magic was wrought upon the universe, an ever expanding source of energy capable of manifesting
psionic and metaphysical powers inside organics. Magic is the basis of all modern technology, its alloys holding impossible
Properties, chemicals and medicines that weren't thought possible, energy that defies thermodynamics. 

Magic twists and distorts everything it contacts, rapid uncontrolled mutations happen on a planetary scale. Reality shifts
and cracks, with time and place losing track of itself. A person either lives to become an apostle, or ends up an 
Abberation. In time, each faction learned how to control or remove Essence. Imperials destroy as much as they can, while
implanting anti-mutation chips into everyone. These chips serve to control the minds of most citizens. Fidelis Ad Imperium.

# Apostles

Apostles are magically gifted humans who choose not to work for the Imperial military, or any non-human with any magical
power. Apostles range from lifting a pebble with their mind, bending a spoon, or lighting a fire, to the very extreme and
almost impossible range of accelerating entire moons out of orbit. Magic is a complicated mess where the more people
who live, the harder it is to become a magic user and the harder it is to become stronger. The more you kill, the stronger
you become. In-lore it requires thousands of kills of people, or millions of animals, or billions of small fish. In-game
it is much easier, this isn't an idle game we're making. Because of how many people exist, and how many are magic users,
nobody has the power to manipulate events on a city-wide or regional scale outside of personal dimensions.

Apostles are incredibly dangerous individuals, practically ungovernable super warriors who create any material or food
they desire from the air and have limitless generation of electricity or resources. They are even so great as to skip
across the planet with teleportation, effortlessly traveling any distance imagined This is why they are purged. Any real 
society vying for control of its population can't have such people, they are an existential threat to the Imperials.

# The Timeframe

Set in the same timeframe as Bright Nights lore, 2200 additionally sets the Imperial invasion as happening during the 
collapse of society and rioting. Intense shelling of the continent, and torching of the ecosystem led to mass and
intense desertification. Much of the fertile topsoil was displaced or blown away. The anomalous influence of unleashed
magic also contributed to desertification and many of the plants/seeds that remained outdoors became anomalous adaptions.
What you have now is in a couple weeks most of North America became an inhospitable desert with little fertile soil,
but patches remain all over thanks to inconsistent bombardment and uneven distribution of magical energy. It may take
years or decades for the forests to regrow and the lakes to form again, but the player can adapt and later thrive.

There is no "blob". That's not how it works in 2200. What XEDRA assumes is the blob must be some form of magical entity,
an apostle. It may be that the blob is simply a non-thinking entity, or not alive and functional at all. Additionally,
the exotic matter XEDRA would be working with was essence. Until magic and it's processes are stabilized, research gets
a little funny. There is no consistent behavior without full stabilization. Nothing within Essence Theory or Tech
would even have been the exact same for XEDRA until the point the invasion started.
