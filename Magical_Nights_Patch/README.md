# Essence2200 + Magical Nights

This Readme outlines what I decided was necessary to patch.

All schools of magic renamed with additional descriptions to match 2200 schools of magic.
Imperials will properly attempt to kill players that choose Magical Nights spell classes via anger relations.

Magic skill renamed since we have two of them now.
