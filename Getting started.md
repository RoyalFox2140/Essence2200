The following professions are in the game, or planned:

Imperial:

Reaper Deserter: A clone trooper with minimal skills and low tier Imperial equipment. Low tier does not mean bad, you start with some powerful stuff.

Reaper Officer: Veteran clones or recruited out of civilians you have a few more skills but importantly you hold decrypted Imperial documents and can start making their lasers and guns if you get the skills and machines ready.



SGA:

Shi Director: A roleplaying and story-driven scenario. As the founder of the Shi Grand Army you possess great ability and power but little skill outside of warfare. You can barely boil water. People will react accordingly and quests will be framed differently.

Arakawa Swordsman: COMING SOON. You're a soldier sent in to clear the cities of zombies before they evolve.

Ishikawa Agent: COMING SOON. You're a soldier sent in to figure out the extent of what XEDRA has done and if there's a way to seal their dimensional breach and cut this dimension off from ours.

Seburo Engineer: COMING SOON. Start in the bunker with knowledge on how to manufacture Shi equipment. Take on field assignments when you're bored of sitting in a bunker.

Director's Sister: A roleplaying and story-driven scenario. Partially completed. You're a pacifist and this is largely trait enforced but you start as a nightstalker and have a guardian. You have a great deal of skills, your goal is to help this dimension in any way you can.



Unaffiliated:

Abberation: A roleplaying scenario. You're a monster with a mutation similar to the Shi Director. You don't have goals but you can go around eating people.

Nightwalker: A roleplaying scenario. You find yourself as the Shi Director except you ended up in this dimension due to unexplained circumstances and thus never founded the Shi. Nobody knows who you are. This breaks a lot of canon and I don't think I could program it to actively delete all Shi items and npc's, but it's there for me to mess about with.



There are three magical awakenings you can choose on chargen as a mutation to get started as a mage. Elemental, Transmutation and Spirit.
