# Essence2200

Welcome to the mod. This is based on my personal writing which I have worked on for over a decade. My story is coming soon, stay tuned. This license was made out of an abundance of caution to protect my story from theft as the mod will have a fair amount of my story bundled inside of it. As such, the following will be important if you wish to use any part of this mod.

The contents of the mod which do not include story elements is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

The story and lore that this mod uses is created by myself solely and under All Rights Reserved. What that means is that while the JSON used to make the items, mutations, spawn groups, spells, and so on are under Creative Commons, the story is not. This story is also used in private mods for other games including Rimworld and Stellaris which have I future plans to make public via steam workshop. I grant permission non-commercially to create patches which work alongside this mod to add, remove, or otherwise change core content. Due to licensing I will not be accepting pull requests or the work of others. At no point may you commercially use anything in this mod, including the story.

Using elements of the story and lore either in full or in parts for the purpose of creating mods for Cataclysm and other games is allowed non-commercially and with appropriate credit by linking to this github page Example, if you wanted to make a mod for Hearts of Iron 4 based on the story you can. In fact I encourage you to get in touch with me and I'd at least give you advice on how best to set up your mod to fit both the game you're trying to mod and follow the story.

An example of what falls under the JSON versus what falls under the story is as follows, a weapon that is added is JSON and all of its properties are JSON, but the name of the weapon and the description would fall under the story.

An example of using the story in part for the purpose of creating mods would be a mod that expands the content of a faction.
