# Essence2200

Welcome to the mod. This is based on my personal writing which I have worked on for over a decade. My story is coming soon, stay tuned. This license was made out of an abundance of caution to protect my story from theft as the mod will have a fair amount of my story bundled inside of it. As such, the following will be important if you wish to use any part of this mod.

As my mod is heavily based on my personal story writing and world building, the mod is licensed under All Rights Reserved. I do not own the source code of Cataclysm: Bright Nights or Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead however and I do not claim to own their source code.

AT NO POINT may you use AI with this repo, you MAY NOT take my work and create an AI overview, you MAY NOT take my work and train your AI models with this. That is a violation of my rights. I will take all necessary actions to eliminate you as a problem.

At no point may you commercially use my mod in any form. At no point may you redistribute my mod, this includes adding it as an in-repository mod in Cataclysm: Bright Nights or Dark Days Ahead. I grant  permission to non-commercially create patches that change the contents of my mod and work alongside it.

Even if a case where the JSON is still licensed under the commercial license of Cataclysm, the contents of my story including names, descriptions, people, are all original works I am currently developing for a web comic. All rights to my story are reserved by myself.

Due to licensing I will not be accepting contributions or pull requests for the project.

In the event of my disappearance, I allow Chaosvolt, Scarf005 and Kenan2000 to fork, maintain, and appoint maintainers to the project.

When I reach a comfortable state of polish and most of the mod is finished it will be eligible to be included in Kenan's structured modpack.
