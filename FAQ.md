Q. My walls and roofs built by transmutation spells don't have roofs? What gives?

A: Blame the game, but do not worry, saving and reloading your world seems to spawn the missing roofs in, it did that for me during testing.

Q: I can't install a machining workstation or an Alloying barrel. Why?

A: Take out the battery. Otherwise the game itself won't allow you.

Q: Will this come to Kenan's structured modpack for Bright Nights?

A: When its done I can ask Kenan. It exists in relative obscurity so I can finish it before throwing it to the wild. The Github page is a good way for people to try it early.
