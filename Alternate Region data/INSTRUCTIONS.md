The easy option: Drop the folder of your choice into your mods folder and run the patch mod you choose. DELETE BLACKLISTS.JSON FROM 2200!!!

The safe option: To FULLY make sure you've changed your region data, Drag one of these files, and replace regional_map_settings.json in Essence 2200, with one of these supported alternatives. Then delete blacklists.json

The reason is I don't know if conflicting region data's might cause problems.
