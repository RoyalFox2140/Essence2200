A list of weapon manufacturers and what they do, by faction

  Shi Grand Army: MAG tech and high level Esstech. Not easily accessible and expensive materials but extremely powerful.

Seburo: Sustained accuracy during high fire rates. Sacrifice damage output. Light armor.

Arakawa: Maximize damage. Magazine capacity and fire rate may suffer. Heavy armor.

Ishikawa: Accuracy and recoil control, balanced guns that don't overwhelmingly focus on one field. Stealth armor.

Kawakami: Wonder projects of ridiculous design and questionable usefulness. More mad science than warfare.


  Imperial: Simple materials and construction, accessible but still holds late game secrets.

Krupp Works: Lasers. From laser pistols to tank cannons.

Edmund Ordnance: A range of ballistic weapons and equipment for the average soldier made from superior materials, mostly compatible with 21st century equivalents.

Golem Arms: Heavy equipment, power armor, nasty surprises. Expect explosives embedded in rifles, integrated underbarrels, high durability equipment.

Chemical Warfare Corps: Handles Esstech and anti-mage warfare, many unconvential weapons that spray acid, fire or essence plasma.

Arbiter Secrets: Top of the line Esstech, a variety of weapons and equipment that use every scrap of knowledge and advanced material the Imperials can produce with mages.
