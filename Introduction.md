Essence 2200 is an unforgiving and brutal total conversion of Cataclysm: Bright Nights.

Set in the same dimension as base-game lore, 2200 thrusts the player and neutral NPC's in a decades-long rebellion
against the Infinite Empire; A post-apocalyptic human Empire now turned into a military junta ran by elite military 
generals and their family/friends. They found their way here from their home dimension. And now, It's your problem.

Go it alone or support an elite cadre of mages against the Imperial invasion. Armed with superior tactics,
Steal technology and manifest magical power as you combat a well-equipped and immense force of space-faring
elite soldiers (and not so well-equipped or elite ones). Become a post-human warrior fueled by nanotechnology,
magic, and rage. Or be turned into soup by the Arbiters; The elite anti-magic taskforce sworn to kill Apostles.
