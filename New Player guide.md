1. If you have **never** played a game like Cataclysm BN:

- Don't turn on Deadlier Zombies
- Play with free form point balance 
- Choose Bunker Blues and Waster or another Profession
- Choose Quick and Fleet-footed
- Avoid too many traits that aren't morale focused
- Avoid starting with skills
- Don't set your Stats past 14
- Don't do things that make no sense in real life, like eating raw meat or drinking unboiled water
- Fear everything

You need to learn how the game works, what you can expect from a normal character, run from danger, and learn crafting progression.

2. If you have never played Essence 2200 and don't want to suffer:

- Don't turn on Deadlier Zombies
- Play any point balance (single point recommended)
- Choose Bunker Blues and a profession that interests you
- Avoid minmaxxing if you care about balance
- Avoid starting with skills from Essence 2200
- Avoid starting as Apostle, SGA, or anyone with a starting laser

3. If you are a **veteran** of the game or genre, or want to suffer:

- Enable Deadlier Zombies
- Play any point balance (single point recommended)
- Do whatever you want
- They're coming to get you, barbara
